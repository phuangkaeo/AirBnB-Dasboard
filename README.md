# Context of the project
Brief airbnb

Everything is going well for Airbnb, they have just raised funds and want to further accelerate their growth. But for you things are a little less well because your boss needs ideas to develop new projects and increase the profitability of Paris. New York headquarters sent him a set of data to inspire him. It therefore returns the data to you and first asks you to summarize what is inside

Find relevant indicators
Understand everything about airbnb activity in Paris
Do not miss anything in the data
Of course, you will represent this on a dashboard illustrated by histograms, point clouds, maps ...

Very helpful, your boss has provided you with dashboard examples to inspire you.

# ++ Organization of your work: ++

Browse the data, make representations with the tools you know (python -matplot) to understand the data. clean it too.
Then list the charts the indicators you want to achieve. You can even use a visual representation tool to get a first representation. (or a pencil and a paper) (We validate the level of three of the competence "Qualification of the data", it is therefore normal that this step is required).
Then build the graphics one by one going to the end and not all at the same time. (This logic may require you at times to redo everything but you will feel like you are moving forward and you will always have something to present.

# ++ Bonus: ++

Airbnb's profitability seems directly linked to the margin made on the price of rentals. Your boss therefore has the idea of ​​increasing the marketing pressure to convince apartment owners whose apartment would have a high price on the platform. For this he would like to know the main characteristics that affect the price. You therefore try to answer this question always by means of your Dashboard (or a new page thereof)

Excited by your work, your chef asks you if it is possible to quickly do the same for Bordeaux and Lyon.

High prices are good, but the units have to be occupied. Would it be possible to act on the occupancy rate of housing or is this linked to exogenous causes. To be sure, your boss asks you to study the impact of the weather on the occupancy of housing.
